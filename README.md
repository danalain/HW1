# Financial Technology Case Study: PayPal
## PayPal and the Founders
PayPal is an American e-commerce company and originated starting from December of 1998. However, it hasn't officially become the PayPal, yet. In March of 2000, Confinity marched with X.com founded by Elon Musk and became the PayPal we all know today. Confinity was founded by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek. Elon Musk joined as Confinity and X.com marched. Then, Peter Thiel, a billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and Yu Pan, a very talented software engineer entered the game and co-founded PayPal. 
## The Funds Started Rolling In!
The idea started with the optimism of Elon Musk on the future of online money transfer process. Confinity was already in the security software business when Elon Musk's X.com joined. Then, Musk decided to focus on the online money transfer process besides other banking operations that X.com was working on before. Initially PayPal was funded by the public when it offered shares of the company. It generated 61 million dollars at the opening of its IPO. In October of 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion dollars. 
## The Paper Checks Alternative
PayPal was started because there was a market for online money transfer services. It does not use the traditional paper checks or the money order and is conveniently processed over the internet. It eliminated the traditional transaction costs such as the time and gas wasted going to the bank or time wasted waiting for the check to arrive or to process, and so on. 
## The Online Payment War
In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the internet retailer, eBay was just beginning to experiment with the online payment system. Confinity was competing ferociously with x.com for customers for their money transfer service. However, both companies were taking blows. Confinity was losing money on promotions for customer acquisition as each day gone by. While x.com was solvent while being not as popular as Confinity. During the battle between the two, eBay brought in Billpoint, another person-to-person payment platform onto the site. It is when the two companies decided to join hand and launch PayPal. However, the company was renamed PayPal in June 2001, a little over a year before eBay acquired it. 
## PayPal’s Customers and Market
You might be asking, “We get it. PayPal is a money transfer service on a digital platform, but how does it make money?” Easy. The transaction fees across its many payment platforms. It also makes money by earning interests and fees from credit loans, subscriptions, and partnership. As of 2019, PayPal operates in 202 markets on global level and has around 305 million active, registered accounts. The users of PayPal are drawn to the easy and accessible payment methods that the company offers. PayPal’s competitive advantage was being one of the first mover of the digital payment methods. Nowadays, with competitions growing with many niche digital payment services, PayPal has been creating new channels such as Venmo, Xoom, Honey, Braintree, iZettle, Tradera and many others to compete and gain other competitive advantages in the markets related to digital financial services. Moreover, PayPal is easy to use, and the best way to get paid outside of U.S, too.
## PayPal’s Technology
At the start of the century, PayPal had problems with its databases. Max Levchin used Oracle platform with expectations of 2 million potential accounts. However, as the scale increased, Elon Musk wanted to carry the company’s database and platform to Microsoft WindowsNT platform. This issue was resolved quickly after. PayPal browser was coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Readers can also access the PayPal’s open source project [here]( http://paypal.github.io). 
Now, PayPal Commerce Platform has transitioned to Node.JS and has been making improvements to make merchant experience more seamless. According to PayPal’s engineering blog, it has adopted a fragments-based approach, also known as Micro Frontend Architecture, which creates an independent user interface component on the page for ownership, development, and deployment. The React components are packaged in node module and are the fragments independently published but with a consistent image for the platform. It can also be built with JS lib, HTML, and CSS. In Layman, these scripts give a personalized and simplified experience to the merchants using PayPal’s Platform.  
## PayPal Makes the Money Moves
This section will further explore the money transfer process that PayPal’s technology carries out ever since its creation. PayPal carries out transfer process called Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers between bank accounts using its digital layer. It services the online and P2P payments. A quick example to an average consumer is an application widely known and used called Venmo that provides a seamless transfer of money for P2P payments powered by PayPal. Merchants can collect the money through PayPal from customers using PayPal even without a PayPal account. For example, I can use my card information that will go to PayPal to buy a product on eBay which will be processed thoroughly and securely before the money spent goes into the merchant’s bank account. In a way, PayPal acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. To do so, whenever the transaction occurs it creates two ACHs to send to both the buyer’s bank to take out money, and the seller’s bank to deposit the money. At the end, PayPal makes both parties happy and do so securely. 
## The Industry and the Progress of Two Decades
PayPal was an industry leader when it revolutionized payment methods. Before eBay acquired PayPal, 25% of customers on eBay were already using PayPal. eBay realized that acquiring PayPal was more suitable business practice rather than to compete with its own Billpoint digital payment service. Since then PayPal has been gaining market size and competitive edge from becoming more popular among users to acquiring other services such as VeriSign in 2005. VeriSign helped PayPal provide added security for its role as an intermediary.
Moreover, PayPal partnered with MasterCard and launched its PayPal Secure Card Services. It increased the landscape of PayPal because PayPal users can now use PayPal as a payment for merchants and websites that does not offer PayPal as a digital payment method.

In 2011, PayPal expands its presence from online to also physical presence offering customers who uses PayPal to be able to purchase products in person in stores. In addition, PayPal also partnered with Discovery Card to establish its presence in Discovery Card network. Previously mentioned company, Xoom Corporation was also acquired by PayPal in 2015 to become more accessible to international users.	 
## How PayPal has Changed the Game
In 2015, PayPal introduced PayPal.Me, a P2P service consumer can send texts, emails, and messages to request money. Later, Venmo changed the game with its easy to use mobile application which became popular with youths and other socialites who can transfer and request money to each other instantly. PayPal has also acquired companies such as iZettle that can analyze sales, payments, funding, and partner application which compliments PayPal as an analytics machine for its business processes. 
## Foresight for PayPal 
With little room to increase it market size, PayPal’s current strategy of acquiring newer financial technology companies that compliments its mission for more efficient online money transfer business is the best way to increase the scope of its business and to land more specialized market within the digital payment business.
